# Video Editor Auto
Edit a video clip based on the difference between each frame.

# How?
The goal of this project was to write an algorithm  which would automatically edit a video clip based on motion. The algorithm removes frames which are different from each other. 

This project uses [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/about.html "ffmpeg") library to handle the video processing.
